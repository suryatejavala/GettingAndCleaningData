>**Note**: The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

>Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

>Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These are our variable

We have 68 variables. In the table bellow we have described the variable.

We are using:
- `u` (unit): frecuency or time (**f** or **t**)
- `measure`: **mean()** or **std()**.
- `direction`: **X**, **Y** or **Z**.

For example u-BodyAcc-measure-direction are 6 variable

tBodyAcc-mean()-X
tBodyAcc-mean()-Y
tBodyAcc-mean()-Z
tBodyAcc-std()-X
tBodyAcc-std()-Y
tBodyAcc-std()-Z
fBodyAcc-mean()-X
fBodyAcc-mean()-Y
fBodyAcc-mean()-Z
fBodyAcc-std()-X
fBodyAcc-std()-Y
fBodyAcc-std()-Z

For example u-BodyAccMag-measure  are 4 variable (2 for unit and 2 for measure 2*2=4)
